# **Recommendation Systems: Movie Recommendation System**


---------------
## **Context**
---------------

Online streaming platforms like **Netflix** have plenty of movies in their repository and if a **Recommendation System** model is built to recommend **relevant movies** to users, based on their **historical interactions**, this would **improve customer satisfaction** and hence, it will also improve the revenue of the platform. The techniques that I have applied here will not only be limited to movies, they can be applied to any item for which a recommendation system is to be built.

-----------------
## **Objective**
-----------------

In this project I will be building various recommendation systems: 
- Knowledge/Rank based recommendation system
- Similarity-Based Collaborative filtering
- Matrix Factorization Based Collaborative Filtering

The **ratings** dataset will be used in this project.
